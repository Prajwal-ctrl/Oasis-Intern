        <p class="para">
          <strong>Sahabzade Irfan Ali Khan</strong> was born in 1967 in
          Rajasthan , India Irrfan Khan (born Sahabzade Irfan Ali Khan; 7
          January 1967 - 29 April 2020),also known simply as Irrfan, was an
          Indian actor who worked in Indian cinema as well as British and
          American films. Cited in the media as one of the finest actors in
          Indian cinema, Khan's career spanned over 30 years and earned him
          numerous accolades, including a National Film Award, an Asian Film
          Award, and six Filmfare Awards. In 2011, he was awarded the Padma
          Shri, India's fourth highest civilian honour. In 2021, he was
          posthumously awarded the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award.

          <br /><br />

          Khan was born on 7 January 1967 in Tonk, Rajasthan into a Muslim
          family of Pathani ancestry. Khan's mother, Saeeda Begum Khan was from
          Tonk, and his father, Yaseen Ali Khan, was from the Khajuriya village
          in Rajasthan's Tonk district, and they ran a tyre business. He spent
          his childhood in Tonk, and then Jaipur. Irrfan was good at cricket and
          was selected to play in the CK Nayudu Trophy for emerging players in
          the under-23 category, a tournament seen as a stepping stone to
          first-class cricket in India. However, he did not attend as he could
          not afford travel expenses. He showed interest in acting under the
          influence of his maternal uncle who himself was a theatre artist in
          Jodhpur. In Jaipur, Khan was introduced to noted theatre artists and
          did several stage performances in the city. Khan completed his MA in
          Jaipur before joining the National School of Drama (NSD) in New Delhi
          in 1984 to study acting. In his early days in Mumbai, he took up a job
          as an air conditioner repairman and visited the home of his acting
          inspiration, Rajesh Khanna, in 1984. Later in an interview Irfan
          stated, "The kind of craze witnessed by Rajesh Khanna has not been
          duplicated by anyone. He was the biggest and the most real star
          Bollywood has produced. I'd say stardom is that feeling of being
          possessed by your idol; you are so overwhelmed with euphoria you lose
          touch with reality."

          <br /><br />

          Khan made his film debut with a small role in Salaam Bombay! (1988),
          which was followed by years of struggle. He acted in a few Film and
          Television Institute of India student films such as Reconnaissance
          (1990), which was directed by Sandeep Chattopadhyay. After starring in
          the British film The Warrior (2001), he had his breakthrough with
          starring roles in the dramas Haasil (2003) and Maqbool (2004). He went
          on to gain critical acclaim for his roles in The Namesake (2006) for
          which he was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best
          Supporting Male, Life in a... Metro (2007), and Paan Singh Tomar
          (2011). For portraying the title character in the last of these, he
          won the National Film Award for Best Actor. Further success came for
          his starring roles in The Lunchbox (2013), Piku (2015), and Talvar
          (2015) and he had supporting roles in the Hollywood films The Amazing
          Spider-Man (2012), Life of Pi (2012), Jurassic World (2015), and
          Inferno (2016). His other notable roles were in Slumdog Millionaire
          (2008), New York (2009), Haider (2014), and Gunday (2014), and the
          television series In Treatment (2010). His highest-grossing Hindi film
          release came with the comedy-drama Hindi Medium (2017), and his final
          film appearance was in its sequel Angrezi Medium (2020), both of which
          won him the Filmfare Award for Best Actor in 2018 and 2021.
